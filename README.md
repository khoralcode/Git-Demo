I receive the error: "Cannot find protocol declaration for 'NSComparisonMethods' ".

Shouldn't the NSComparisonMethods protocol exist within Foundation.h, or is that a protocol that I have to write myself? I've written a custom protocol with the same title and included methods, which I found when looking up the protocol. After importing that custom protocol, I was able to make use of it within my custom Fraction class. 

Am I doing something wrong? I was under the impression that I could simply list a protocol and make a class conform to its methods... I'm very confused! Any thoughts or tips would be greatly appreciated.
